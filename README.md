CMSmap is a python open source CMS scanner that automates the process of detecting security flaws of the most popular CMSs. The main purpose of CMSmap is to integrate common vulnerabilities for different types of CMSs in a single tool.

At the moment, CMSs supported by CMSmap are WordPress, Joomla, Drupal and Moodle.

Installation
=====
You can download the latest version of CMSmap by cloning the GitHub repository:

    edbpath = /opt/exploitdb/

Alternatively, use `APT` if you have installed the `debian` exploitdb package. For Kali, use the following settings :

    [exploitdb]
    edbtype = APT
    edbpath = /usr/share/exploitdb/

If you would like to run `cmsmap` from anywhere in your system you can install it with `pip3` :

    cd CMSmap
    pip3 install .

To uninstall it :

    pip3 uninstall cmsmap -y
